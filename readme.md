This is somewhat of a fork of [ShakataGaNai/hid-prox-weigand.ino](https://gist.github.com/ShakataGaNai/4319d3e82a858c9d00c1d80f20da81a3) turned in to a full repo. The main difference is this has support for 37bit data format.

More of just a little experiment to be able to scan HID/Weigand badges and get the badge identifiers.
